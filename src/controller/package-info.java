/**
 * This package provides a {@code FrontController} class that handles the flow of the program, input requests
 * and input processing, exception handling, and also {@code Model} and {@code View} components handling.
 * Front Controller Pattern and Singleton Design Pattern are used. The available requests are inside {@code requests}
 * package. If a new type of request needs to be added, it should {@code extend} the abstract {@code Request} class.
